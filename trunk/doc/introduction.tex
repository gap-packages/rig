\atindex{racks package}{@racks package}

The GAP 4 package {\RiG} provides a library of functions for computations
related to racks. This package can also be used to make basic calculations 
of cohomology of finite racks.
 
In chapter 2 we give a short summary of parts of the theory of finite racks
and Nichols algebras. This fixes the notations and definitions that we use. 
In chapter 3 we describe the functions that constitute the package.

To load the package, type:
