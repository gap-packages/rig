TODO LIST
=========
* To add: CayleyGraph
* To add: Betti, Torsion, Generators for the free part
* To fix: AreHomologous: general not only n=2, AreHomologous<-->IsHomologous
* To add: IsCohomologous, at least for n=2
* To add: abelian extensions
* To add: Center, IsSimple
* To add: Display functions, notation for knot theory
* To add: Alternatives to compute the automorphism group
* To fix: LocalExponent and LocalExponents (exclude the trivial case)
* To fix: labels and subracks
* To fix: SmallQuandles library
* To fix: SmallQuandle and NrSmallQuandles to get the list of all indecomposable quandles
* To fix: SmallQuandle(p, i) should be the affine rack (p, i)
* To fix: YetterDrinfeldGroup should be a permutation group

TO CHECK
========
* IsGoodInvolution

MANUAL
======
* Subracks 
* (Finite) enveloping group
* Hurwitz actions
* Nichols algebras  
* Background and References

IDEAS
=====
* Rename: basis --> gens
* The inner group is a normal subgroup of the automorphism group!
* SAGE interface?
* Derivations for Nichols algebras?
* Category: IsRack?
* To add: typeD for racks?
* Gauss diagrams?
