TODO LIST
=========

TO ADD
======
* CayleyGraph
* Generators for the free part
* Center, IsSimple
* Display functions, notation for knot theory
* Alternatives to compute the automorphism group

TO FIX
======
* LocalExponent and LocalExponents (exclude the trivial case)
* Labels and subracks

TO IMPROVE
==========
* SmallQuandles library for (affine) racks of p elements
* YetterDrinfeldGroup should be a permutation group

CHECK
=====
* IsGoodInvolution
* AbelianExtensioins

MANUAL
======
* Subracks 
* (Finite) enveloping group
* Hurwitz actions
* Nichols algebras  
* Background and References
* Small library of indecomposable quandles

IDEAS
=====
* Rename: basis --> gens
* To add: IsCohomologous for n>2
* The inner group is a normal subgroup of the automorphism group!
* SAGE interface?
* Derivations for Nichols algebras?
* Category: IsRack?
* To add: typeD for racks?
* Gauss diagrams?
