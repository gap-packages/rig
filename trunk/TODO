TODO LIST
=========
* To add: CayleyGraph, Betti, Torsion, abelian extensions, Center, IsSimple
* Notation for knot theory, check (co)homology.
* Polynomials invariants of racks: improve
* Manual: 
	Examples: (co)homology, AlexanderRacks, IsFaithFul, Polynomial invariants
    Subracks, Nichols algebras
	Background and References
* General:
	Labels!
	Topology or algebra?
* base?
* Rename: basis --> gens
* The inner group is a normal subgroup of the automorphism group!
* SAGE interface
* Category: IsRack
* Method: Rack(i,j)=i>j in order to define racks as a list of permutations!
